1. What is node?
Node js is a open source, cross-plateform runtime environment for executing javascirpt code
outside of a browser(server).
we often use node to build back-end servies also called API(Application Programming Interface).
Node is idea for building highly-scalable, data-intensive and real-time apps.

1.1 Why to use node js?
- Greate for prototyping and agile development.
- use for building superfast and highly scalable services. it is used in large company such as 
  Uber, Netflix, Paypal etc.
- Cleaner and more consistent codebase.
- large ecosystem of open-source library.

2. Node Architecture (Runtime environment is a environment in which a program or application is
executed)

Before node we use javascirpt only to build Application run inside a browser. Every browser out
there what we called JS Engine that takes our JS code and convert it to machine code. for e.g
Chakra (microsoft edge), V8(Chrome), SpiderMonkey(firebase).
Browser provide run time environment for JS code. Up to 2009 the only way to run js code 
is inside browser. In 2009 Ryan Dahl crator of node js came up with grate idea and he tooks
google v8 engine which is a fastest JS engine out there and enbedded it inside a C++ Programming
and called that program node.
Similar to browser node is a runtime environment for JS code. With node js we can work with
filesystem, network, etc.

3. How node works
- Node app are highly scalable because of asynchronous or non blocking nature of node. 
- what is asynchronous nature:- let say you went to resturent, a waiter come and takes
your order and go to the kitchen and told a order item to a chef and come and 
take another order. waiter does not wait in kitchen to cook the recipes insted of that 
he take another order and chef is cooking a recipes. This is a metaphor of asynchronous 
Architecture. This is how node app work.

- A single thread is used to handle multiple request.
- Node is ideal for I/O-intensive apps.
- Do not use Node for CPU-intensive apps like video encoding, image manuplation, etc.
  kind of app that have alots of calculation that happen in CPU. 
- it is used for data intensive and real time intensive apps.

4. Your first node program
function sayHello(name){
    console.log("hello" + name)
}
sayHello(Govinda)

node fileName (to execute code)

node is a C++ program that include chrome v8 engine. node give code to v8 engine to execution.
windows, documention objects are not part of node because they execute in browser. in node we
other object to work with file, OS, etc.
