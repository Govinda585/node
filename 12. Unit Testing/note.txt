1. What is Automated Testing?

is it replacement for manual testing?
Do i really need it?
How should i do it?
Test first(TDD) or code first?
or should write the applicaion code first.

Automated testing is the practice of writing code to test our code,
and  run those tests in an automated fashion.

Now we can application code and test code

2. Benefits of automated testing

1. test your code frequently in less time 
2. Catch bugs before deploying
3. Deploy with confidence
4. reudce the bug and improve the quality of software 
5. Refactor with confidence
Refactoring means changing the structure of the code 
without changing its behavior.
if you rename a method that is refactoring. when we don't 
have automated test every time you refactor you code then 
we have to test it menually that is time consuming but with 
automated test we can test easy.
6. It helps you focus more on quality of method writing method.

3. Types of Tests

In automated testing we have three types of test 
Unit test 
Integration test 
End-to-end

1. Unit test 
Tests a unit of an application without its external dependencies such as 
files, database, web service, etc. Unit test code are cheap to write
and execute fast so we can run 100's of them in a few seconds.
In this way we can verify each block of code is working or not in an 
application however without integration we it does not give a lots 
of confidents.

2. Integration test 
Tests the application with its external dependencies so it test 
the integration of application code like files, database and so on.
This takes loger to execute because it often invove in reading and 
writing data but it give more confidence.

3. End-to-end test 
Drives and application through its UI. They are specific tools build 
to for creating end to end test. one popular tool is Selenium.
Which allows us to record interaction of user with our app and play
back and check if the app is returing the right result or not.
This test give you the greatest confidence but they have to big 
problem first is they are too slow and second  problem is very 
brittle.
